<p>Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without. This, too, will pass. Peace comes
    from within. Do not seek it without. If the facts don't fit the theory, change the facts.
    You will not be punished for your anger, you will be punished by your anger. The
    smaller your reality, the more convinced you are that you know everything. The
    past has no power over the present moment. If the facts don't fit the theory, change
    the facts.
    You will not be punished for your anger, you will be punished by your anger.</p>

<p>The most important moment of your life is now. The most important person in your
    life is the one you are with now, and the most important activity in your life is the
    one you are involved with now.</p>
